I am a highly motivated data analysis enthusiast with strong skills in SQL and Power BI, seeking an internship opportunity to apply my analytical expertise in real-world projects. In my portfolio, you'll find several projects where I have:

- **Built robust SQL queries and procedures** to extract, transform, and analyze large datasets. For instance, I developed dynamic reports that track revenue trends, customer segmentation (using RFM analysis), and product performance metrics.
- **Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations** that communicate key business insights effectively. My dashboards cover topics such as geographical revenue breakdown, sales performance trends (daily, monthly, and yearly), and product analysis.
- **Integrated advanced analytical techniques**, including percentile-based segmentation and window functions, to deliver actionable insights for decision-makers.

## 🔹 Skills & Expertise
- SQL: Advanced querying, WINDOW FUNCTIONS (LAG, LEAD, PARTITION BY, WINDOW FRAME), PIVOT TABLE, stored procedures, and automation with CURSOR & TRIGGER.
- Power BI: Designing interactive dashboards for data-driven storytelling.
- Data Mining & Statistics: Applying statistical techniques to uncover trends and patterns.
- E-commerce & Marketing Analytics: Customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and campaign performance tracking.
